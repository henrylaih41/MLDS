Train : sh train.sh
Test : sh test.sh

Please put MLDS_hw2_data in the folder before running the files.
Be sure to run train.sh and train for 1 epoch before running test.sh
otherwise the save dir would be empty
The output.txt created by test.sh contains the  predictions of the model created by train.sh
The model of output_0.69.txt is not in this dir. (Too big to upload)
